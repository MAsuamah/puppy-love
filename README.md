## Future Developments

### Ability to Organize Doggy Dates and Search Nearby Dog Parks
As the wireframe shows we would like to add the ability for pups to plan meetups right on the website. When your visit a dog profile you should be able to find a middle button click it select a date to meetup. We would also like to implement a map where users can find nearby dog parks.
